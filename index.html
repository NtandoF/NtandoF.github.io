          <h3>About me</h3>
          <p>I was Born on the 15th of February in 1990, I grew up with my relatives in a small Langa township just right oustide of Cape Town. I grew up just like any othe small boy in the township because we were all disadvantaged. so i started school in a local school called Tembani thats where i obtained my lower grades. Then I finished my primary in the Eastern cape in King William's town due to mis-behaviour. I went there for three years and the i get back to Cape Town to finish my Secondary level which was 2010. in October 2011 i started to work for Capacity as a general worker until 2016. where i made a choice to stepout of my comfort zone and make something better of my life so that started by following my childhood dream of becoming a programmer. I then went to local NPO called Brothers for all which year later changed to quirky30 thats where i started my learning. In January I did two modules in Networking programme which was funded by Governments SETA. in February I was invited for a JavaScript Bootcamp by CodeX and the i got in their Apprenticiship where i will be trained to be come a Full-Stack javascript software developer </p>
